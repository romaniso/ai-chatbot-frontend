This repository implements a versatile AI chatbot powered by ChatGPT, offering two distinct frontend integration methods:

**Web Component Integration**: Seamlessly embed the chatbot functionality directly within your webpages using a script tag. This approach provides tight control over the chatbot's appearance and behavior within your existing application.

**iFrame Integration**: Utilize an iFrame to embed the chatbot as a self-contained unit. This method offers a simpler integration process and is well-suited for scenarios where you want to keep the chatbot's styling and behavior independent.

## Frontend

### Technology Stack:

- Vanilla JavaScript (JS): Provides the core functionality for the chatbot's interactive elements and logic.

- CSS: Manages the visual presentation of the chatbot, including its styling and layout.

### Branch Structure:

The project is divided into **two main branches**, each catering to a specific frontend integration style:

- **component-approach**: This branch focuses on the web component approach, providing the necessary code to embed the chatbot as a custom web component within your webpages. [link to the branch](https://github.com/romaniso/ai-chatbot-frontend/tree/component-approach).

- **iframe-approach**: This branch houses the code for the iFrame integration, allowing you to embed the chatbot using an iFrame element.
  This structure facilitates a clear separation of concerns and simplifies the integration process for your chosen approach. [link to the branch](https://github.com/romaniso/ai-chatbot-frontend/tree/iframe-approach)

## Backend

[You can find the repo of the backend here](https://github.com/romaniso/ai-chatbot).

### Technology Stack:

Node.js with Express.js

### Functionality:

- Acts as a lightweight microservice.
- Handles incoming requests from the frontend.
- Utilizes Express.js for efficient request routing and handling.
- Interacts with the OpenAI API to send user messages to ChatGPT for processing.
- Manages conversation context by storing past messages with cookies.
- Returns the generated response from ChatGPT to the frontend.
